Westford
=====================

A Wayland OpenGL compositor written in Java.
This is a work in progress and not ready for day to day use, however
certain features like client movement and render output on X are considered ready.

Javadoc
=======
Not available yet.

Building
========
Run `maven install` in the root of the project.

Running
=======
Go in the `bootstrap/target` folder. Type `java -jar bootstrap-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
Next fire up some test clients from the Weston compositor (eg `weston-terminal`). 
Make sure you use Weston 1.4 as more recent versions depend on xdg-shell which is not 
yet implemented by Westford.
