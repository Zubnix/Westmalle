Westford
=====================

A Wayland OpenGL compositor written in Java.
This is a work in progress and not ready for day to day use, however
certain features like client movement and render output on X are considered ready.

Building
========
Prerequisites: 
- maven
- cmake 
- docker (optional, needed for build-in cross compilation) 

Run `mvn package` in the root of the project. Westford is still under heavy 
development, so occasionally tests might fail. If this is the case you can run the build
with `mvn package -DskipTests`.

To cross compile for a specific architecture, set the corresponding profile in the maven build command.
Available profiles are:

| Architecture | Profile     |
|:------------:|:-----------:|
| aarch64      |linux-aarch64|
| armv7hf      |linux-armv7hf| 
| armv7sf      |linux-armv7sf|
| armv6hf      |linux-armv6hf|
| x86_64       |linux-x86_64 |
| i686         |linux-i686   |
| all of above |all          |

So if we were to build for `armv7hf`, our build command would becomes `mvn package -DskipTests -Plinux-armv7hf`.
This will trigger a cross compilation inside an cleanly isolated docker container.

If no profile is selected, the maven build will default to the `native` profile, which corresponds to
the architecture that you're currently building on, without the use of docker.

Running
=======
Westford can be launched using different back-ends and configuration. These live as separate projects
under `launch`

Currently the following back-ends exist:
- `launch/x11`A back-end that outputs to a regular X11 window, one window per (virtual) screen. Ideal for quick testing.
- `launch/x11.html5` Wraps the X11 back-end, and enables input and output using a browser and an html5 canvas (experimental). 
- `launch/drm.direct` Uses the kernel's drm/kms system to directly output to the screen, without the use of X11. Root user only. 
- `launch/drm.indirect`Uses the kernel's drm/kms system to directly output to the screen, without the use of X11. All users.
- `launch/dispmanx` Raspberry Pi 1/2/3 (experimental)


Running under X11
=================
Go into the `launch/x11/target` folder. Type `java -jar x11-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
Next fire up some test clients from the Weston compositor (eg `weston-terminal`). 
Make sure you use Weston 1.4 as more recent versions depend on xdg-shell which is not 
yet implemented by Westford.

To configure the X11 back-end, open up `org.westford.compositor.launch.x11.X11PlatformConfigSimple` 
found in `X11PlatformConfigSimple.java` and adjust as required.

Running with drm/kms
====================
//TODO

Dependencies
============
The following native libraries are expected:
 - libc
 - pixman-1
 - EGL
 - GLESv2
 - libdrm (drm/kms back-end)
 - libpng (x11-html5 back-end)
 - libudev (drm/kms + rpi back-end)
 - libinput (rpi & drm/kms back-end)
 - X11 (x11 back-end)
 - xcb (x11 back-end)
 - X11-xcb (x11 back-end)
 - xkbcommon
 - xkbcommon-x11 (x11 back-end)
 - bcm_host (rpi back-end)
 - linux
